* The Issue
OpenGL is retained. So if we want an immediate mode API, we have to
translate our immediate-mode model into a retained-mode model.

* Rebuild Vertices Every Frame
** Pros
- Simplicity
- Better performance on the CPU
- Performance would scale directly with surface count
** Cons
- Little room for optimization
* Manage Vertices Dynamically
** Pros
- Better performance on the GPU
