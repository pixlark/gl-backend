----------------------------------

Figure out how to do rotations in OpenGL on a vSet basis. Should we
pass origin and rotation to each vertice individually? That seems like
a waste of space. Also, the shader should take into account resolution
scale so that rotated pixels stay in the proper grid. Perhaps we
should pass a uniform in to the shaders that notifies it of the
resolution scale?
